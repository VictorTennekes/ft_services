						My name is Victor Tennekes and I'm a 19 year old programming student from Amsterdam.
						I spent 7 years in highschool and things weren't necessarily going as they would need to go if I wanted to get my diploma.
						At the beginning of my last year I decided to just finish the schoolyear so I at least had a chance to get my diploma, and if I wouldn't I'd figure it out.
						Thats when I heard about <a class="text-link" href="https://42.fr/">42</a> and It's dutch counterpart <a class="text-link" href="https://www.codam.nl/">CODAM</a>. And here we are about 6 months later
						(at the time of writing) and I've never felt more at home than behind the computer writing code with my peers.
